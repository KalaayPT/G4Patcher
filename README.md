# Pokemon Gen 4 Code Injection Patcher

This is a small thing ive written up to easily distribute .asm patches for code injecting things such as EV+IV-checking and Portable PC routines, because i was tired of explaining and writing out every patch separately.

This program is purely cli. It prompts you to select an unpacked ROM folder (such as one generated by [DSPRE](https://github.com/Mixone-FinallyHere/DS-Pokemon-Rom-Editor/tree/v1.13.1-beta)), then one of the included patches, then checks for:
1. Is the patch compatible with your game? (by comparing game header with patch name, so if you want to contribute your own patches, make sure to label your patches corrrectly)
2. Can you even inject the patch, i.e. is your arm9 expanded?
3. Is there free space in the synthOverlay and where is said space

After checking these things, it adjusts the patch file with the corrected injection address and runs the patch through armips.

An [armips](https://github.com/Kingcom/armips) binary is bundled into the release, so no need to install anything else!

## Usage:

1. Run G4Patcher
2. Select your unpacked ROM folder
3. Select the patch
4. If everything is fine, youll get a confirmation message, if not, you'll get a message telling you what the issue is
5. Press Enter to close

## Included patches:

### EV+IV Checker (HG/SS)

When applied, holding R while opening the summary/switching to a pokemon in the summary screen will display IVs instead of stats. L for EVs.

## Contributing:

If you want to dontribute your own patches, you can use the included ones as templates as to what yours are supposed to look like. 

Make sure that:
1. The patch name is clearly labeled with the ROM it is to be applied to (such as "_HG")
2. The patch includes a:
```armasm
INJECT_ADDR equ 0x023C8750
.org INJECT_ADDR
```
so that the script is able to adjust the injection address
